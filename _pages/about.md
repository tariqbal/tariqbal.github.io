I am an Assistant Professor of Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. My group is interested in building robotic systems that are capable of working alongside people in complex human environments. 

Prior to joining UVA, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I worked with Professor Julie Shah. I received my Ph.D. from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) with Professor Laurel Riek.

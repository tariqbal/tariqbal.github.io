I am an Assistant Professor of Systems and Information Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Virginia. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. I lead the <a href="https://www.collabrobotics.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Collaborative Robotics Lab (CRL)</a> at UVA. My group is interested in building robotic systems that are capable of working alongside people in complex human environments. 

Prior to joining UVA, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I worked with Professor Julie Shah. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) with Professor Laurel Riek.

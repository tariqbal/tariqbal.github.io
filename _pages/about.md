I am an Assistant Professor of Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. My group is interested in building robotic systems that are capable of working alongside people in complex human environments. 

Prior to joining UVA, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I received my Ph.D. from the University of California San Diego, M.S. from the University of Texas at El Paso, and B.S. from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

I am an Assistant Professor of Systems and Information Engineering, and Computer Science at the University of Virginia, where I lead the <a href="https://www.collabrobotics.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Collaborative Robotics Lab (CRL)</a>. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with a focus on developing robotic systems that can operate effectively alongside humans in complex, real-world environments. My work has been recognized with several honors, including the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award, and the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing
(CCAM) Innovation Award.

Before joining the University of Virginia, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I worked with Professor Julie Shah. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California San Diego (UCSD), under the supervision of Professor Laurel Riek.
